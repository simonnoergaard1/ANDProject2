A brief description of the application and the motivation behind it.
A list of MoSCoW prioritized requirements

The application that i want to develop is some kind of dinner roulette/spin the wheel. The app will have different features, but basically you can add all cooking recipes to a list and spin the wheel with these recipes.
My motivation for this idea was that i have a daily struggle of what dinner to make. I like to cook, and i am pretty good at it. But sometimes it can just be hard to make the decission on what to make. 

MosCow prioritized requirements:

Must have:

- [x] Spin feature / Modified to be a random picker
- [x] personal list with recipes
- [ ] add friend / showed as an user list


Should have: 

- [x] Personal profile
- [x] gallery
- [x] login page

None of the below have been implemented in the final version:

Could have:
Point system, ranking system, feed feature(Here you can check in with your friends and share recipes)

Will not have:
Refrigerator item recipe selector?, chat system
