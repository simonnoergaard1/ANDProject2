A brief description of the application and the motivation behind it.
A list of MoSCoW prioritized requirements

The application that i want to develop is some kind of dinner roulette/spin the wheel. The app will have different features, but basically you can add all cooking recipes to a list and spin the wheel with these recipes. If you cook together with friends you can combine your lists and then spin. You can also browse your friends recipes and get inspiration. 
My motivation for this idea was that i have a daily struggle of what dinner to make. I like to cook, and i am pretty good at it. But sometimes it can just be hard to make the decission on what to make. 

MosCow prioritized requirements:

Must have:
Spin feature, personal list with recipes, add friend

Should have: 
Personal profile, gallery, login page

Could have:
Point system, ranking system, feed feature(Here you can check in with your friends and share recipes)

Will not have:
Refrigerator item recipe selector?, chat system
